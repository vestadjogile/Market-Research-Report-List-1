<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Single-Stage Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Single-suction Type"</li><li>"Double-suction Type"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical single-stage pumps are categorized primarily into single-suction and double-suction types. Single-suction pumps draw fluid from one side, making them suitable for lower flow applications and simpler designs. In contrast, double-suction pumps have two inlets, allowing for higher flow rates and balanced hydraulic forces, reducing axial thrust. The choice between these types depends on the specific application requirements, such as flow rate, efficiency, and pressure. Both types are essential in various industries, including water treatment, HVAC, and irrigation.</p></p>
